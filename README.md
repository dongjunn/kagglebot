# Community Guidelines
Guidelines are important for a good community. As the community grows, the need to define rules grows as well. We have come up with certain guidelines that all members of the KaggleNoobs slack should adhere to.  


# Channels: 
1. **ama:** This channel is used for interviewing **Kaggle Grandmasters**. Once in a while, an interview with any of the grandmasters is conducted so that the community members can learn from their experiences. **Do not post anything in this channel.**

2. **fastai:** This channel is mostly for those people who are interested in doing [fastai](fast.ai) courses. You can ask all your fastai related queries here. 

3: **general:** This is the channel which is suited to general queries. The queries posted here can be anything related to Data Science or Machine Learning in general. There are certain things that you should be aware of when posting anything in this channel:
  * Do not post **stackoverflow** questions here. Technical questions related to the functionalities of a library or something related to your code should be posted on stackoverflow only.
  * Do not discuss anything that related to a competition that effects leaderboard. Any such discussion is kind of cheating because people who are not on this slack don't have that information. Any such discussion should happen only on the competition discussion forums.
  * **Promotions** in #general are a big **NO**. If you think you have built something that can be helpful for the community, a one-time promotion is allowed in **#random**.
  * Keep discussion related to a query in a single **thread**. If you don't know about threads or how to create one, check [this](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/115000769927-Message-and-file-threads) guide for the same.
  * **Be humble.** If you are asking questions and someone is helping you out, make sure you take that help into account. Nobody would ever ask you for `Thank you` directly but if you don't, it feels that like you are taking the help for granted.
  * Do not post **homework** or **assignments** in general until unless you have dug into the problem enough and looked for the solutions on the internet which didn't turn out helpful. 
  * Do not use **offensive** things, be it verbal or pictorial. We take offensive things in a very serious manner and using one can lead to a permanent ban from the community.
